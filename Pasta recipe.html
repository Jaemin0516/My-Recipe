            <br> <br> The process if making

            <img src="ball1.jpg"/>
            <br>When the pot water starts to boil, add pasta noodles and boil for 10 minutes.</p>
            <img src="ball2.jpg"/>
            <br>Put all the boiled pasta noodles in a bowl and mix them with a little olive oil.</p>
            <img src="ball3.jpg"/>
            <br>* Olive oil plays a role in preventing pasta noodles from swelling.
            <br>Put the meat in a frying pan and stir-fry it with a little minced garlic, cooking wine, salt, and pepper.</p>
            <img src="ball4.jpg"/>
            <br>* In addition to meat spaghetti, pork meat is good to eat in addition to various dishes such as fried rice and bibimbap, so make a lot at once, store it in a refrigerator, and take it out whenever necessary.</p>
            <br>Put a lot of meat on the boiled pasta noodles.	</p>
            <img src="ball5.jpg"/>
            <br>Put the  meat spaghetti sauce on top.</p>
            <img src="ball6.jpg"/>
            <br>Put a handful of mozzarella cheese on top of it!	</p>
            <img src="ball7.jpg"/>
            <br>Now put it in the microwave and melt the cheese for 3 minutes to complete the meat spaghetti dish.</p>
            <img src="ball8.jpg"/>
            <br>* Cook with a microwave lid.
            <br>Use chopsticks or forks to mix noodles and cheese well!</p>

        <h2>Cream Sauce Pastaü§çüçù</h2>
                <p>Supplies <br> 150g meat spaghetti sauce, 1 person pasta, 1 handful mozzarella cheese, 1/2T olive oil, 200g pork meat, 1/2T minced garlic, 1T matte wine, a little salt, pepper
                    <br> <br> The process if making
                    <br> <br>First, cut the bacon into bite-sized pieces. Wash and cut the button mushrooms,too.</p>
                    <img src="cream1.jpg"/>
                    <br>I'll make a cream pasta about the size of a 100-won coin. Even if it looks small, the amount will be perfect if the noodles are cooked and cream sauce is added.</p>
                    <img src="cream2.jpg"/>
                    <br>Add a little salt to boiling water and bring to a boil.</p>
                    <img src="cream3.jpg"/>
                    <br>Spread out the pasta dry noodles evenly.</p>
                    <img src="cream4.jpg"/>
                    <br>Put the noodles in boiling water with chopsticks and cook for about 5 minutes. When you cook the noodles in boiling water
                    You can shorten the time when you stir-fry it with cream sauce later.</p>
                    <img src="cream5.jpg"/>
                    <br>Transfer the pasta noodles cooked in boiling water for about 5 minutes to a strainer. At this time! Don't rinse in cold water, just cool the pasta noodles as it is.</p>
                    <img src="cream6.jpg"/>
                    <br>Now I'm going to make the cream pasta sauce! Put just enough olive oil in a heated frying pan, add the minced garlic, and stir-fry.
                    Add the butter when the minced garlic is cooked to a certain extent. And when the butter has melted, add the button mushrooms and stir-fry.
                    Once the button mushrooms is well-cooked, add the shredded onions and bacon.</p>
                    <img src="cream7.jpg"/>
                    <br>Add 180ml of white milk and boil it!
                    Add two pieces of cheddar cheese to make the cream pasta sauce thick. If the sauce is bland, add the salt little.</p>
                    <img src="cream8.jpg"/>
                    <br>Add pasta noodles that were resting in the strainer.
                    Mix the pasta noodles and cream sauce well.</p>
                    <img src="cream10.jpg"/>
                    <br>Sprinkle pepper on the finished cream pasta and you're done.</p>
